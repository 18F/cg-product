# Make cloud.gov words consistent

Do you ever write cloud.gov outage updates, dev docs, compliance docs, or other words about cloud.gov? Do you want to...

* ...write helpful info that helps our readers trust us?
* ...never wonder again how to capitalize cloud.gov, BOSH, or GitHub?

OK, follow this guide!

Consistency helps cloud.gov look trustworthy and reliable, and it reduces potential reader confusion.

## Use these exact strings for tricky product names, abbreviations, and team names

Use these exact strings (keeping this spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and spacing):

* **18F**
* **Amazon Web Services**
* **BOSH**
* **Cloud Foundry**
* **cloud.gov** (always lowercase, even at the beginning of a sentence)
* **Concourse**
* **Dashboard** (formerly *Deck* or *Console*)
* **EC2**
* **ElastiCache**
* **Elasticsearch**
* **ELK**
* **FedRAMP**
* **Git**
* **GitHub**
* **GovCloud**
* **Infrastructure as a Service** (or **IaaS**)
* **New Relic** 
* **Platform as a Service** (or **PaaS**)
* **StatusPage**
* **Virtual Private Cloud**
* **YAML**

## Use these non-case-sensitive strings for words with tricky spacing and punctuation

These words should be lowercased in the middle of a sentence and capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, but use this exact spacing and punctuation.

* **email**
* **federal**
* **internet**
* **jump box**
* **one-time authentication code** (this is good to use instead of *one time code* or *one-time registration code*)
* **role-based access control**
* **third-party credentials**
* **timestamp**
* **website**

## Use active voice instead of passive voice

Use active voice, especially when you're writing technical explanations. For example: *"the subject did something"*, such as *"the cluster recorded the data"*.

If you write sentences in passive voice (*"something was done"*), such as *"the data was recorded"*, your sentence is hiding important technical information: what did the action? What recorded the data?

Using active voice is especially important for incident reports (such as outage descriptions). If we write with passive voice, the result can sound like we're not taking full responsibility for our actions and mistakes.

Active voice is also important for technical documentation (including compliance documentation). When you clearly state which part of the system is doing which action, this helps readers understand how the system works.

## Working on our compliance documentation?

### How to capitalize roles

Capitalize roles to help readers understand that you're talking about specific roles rather than just groups of people in general.

For example:

* Authorizing Official
* Cloud Operations
* Information System Security Officer

### Customer responsibilities

Write “**Customer Responsibility**” in bold whenever we want to indicate that something is a customer responsibility (not “Client Application” or other titles).
