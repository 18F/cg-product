# Cloud.gov Product Management
Program-level artifacts, workflow and status for delivery of products within the cloud.gov umbrella

## What is cloud.gov?

cloud.gov is a set of tools designed and supported by US government workers, for US government work. cloud.gov's mission is to reduce the barriers to rapid, incremental, compliant, secure, and scalable delivery of government services for all government agencies by leveraging best-of-breed modern practices in an opinionated way.

cloud.gov consists of:

- **the [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**
 - "cloud.gov" commonly refers to the cloud.gov PaaS, which was cloud.gov's first product. The PaaS provides a comfortable abstraction which handles cloud-based operations and greatly reduces the complications of infrastructure management for delivery teams. Our PaaS builds on the widely-used and open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/), deployed with practices geared toward meeting [strict government compliance requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act_of_2002).
- **the [Compliance Toolkit](https://github.com/18F/compliance-toolkit) continuous assurance service**
 - Compliance Toolkit provides a heads-up view of code quality and security suitable for integration into a delivery team's CI/CD system. Compliance Toolkit helps teams develop to a high standard, enter the compliance process with confidence, and demonstrate continued high quality/compliance long after they have [Authority to Operate](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/faqs/what-is-an-authority-to-operate-ato/), as new requirements and vulnerabilities emerge. Compliance Toolkit includes Compliance Masonry, which transforms compliance documentation from static text to composable, testable code. Compliance Toolkit can be used with or without the cloud.gov PaaS, but is easier to take advantage of for apps being deployed there. 

## Roadmap and ChangeLog

For now, this is in [another tool](https://18f.aha.io/products/CGP/bookmarks/project_timelines/new) only accessible by 18F personnel. Soon we will embed the information directly here.

## Following our work in progress

We are using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io) to provide a top-level kanban board and burndown charts showing the status of related work happening across many repositories in GitHub. Install it, then click "Boards" above to see it.

## Delivery Process

We document [the processes that govern the delivery of our work](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/DeliveryProcess.md), which is shared (and potentially embellished) by various teams/sub-projects in other repositories. Our process is revised periodically when we reflect on common patterns observed across retrospectives.

## Including new repositories in this program

To include artifacts from another repository in our program-level view, use ZenHub to set up a board that resembles [the program board](https://github.com/18F/cg-product#boards?repos=39210774,55727091). Then merge that board into the program board, mapping similar columns appropriately.
