# Cloud.gov Product Management
Program-level artifacts, workflow and status for products within the cloud.gov umbrella

## Viewing our status

We are using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io) to provide a top-level kanban board and burndown charts showing the status of related work happening across many repositories in GitHub. Install it, then click "Boards" above to see it.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Standard practices that govern the quality of our work are captured in this explicit [Definition of Done](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/DoD.md) (DoD), which is shared (and potentially embellished) by various teams/sub-projects. The contents of our program's DoD are revised periodically when we reflect on common patterns arising across retrospectives.
